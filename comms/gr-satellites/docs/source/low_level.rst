Low level blocks
================

Low level blocks are the custom blocks offered by gr-satellites to implement the
required functionality that is not available in the standard GNU Radio
blocks. There are many different low level blocks, and some of them date back to
the first versions of gr-satellites and have become somewhat outdated. A
complete description of the low level blocks is outside the scope of the
documentation for this version of gr-satellites.

It is likely that low level blocks will be classified and documented better in
the future, perhaps deprecating some of the most outdated old blocks.

For the mean time, the user interested in learning how the different low level
blocks can be used can explore which low level blocks are used by the
components, by looking at the Python sources inside ``python/components/``.
