Installation
============

There are currently three major ways to install gr-satellites:

* :ref:`Building from source <Installing from source>`
* :ref:`Installing using conda <Installing using conda>`
* :ref:`Using the Ubuntu PPA <Installing using the Ubuntu PPA>`

Installing from the Ubuntu PPA is the easiest and recommended way to install
gr-satellites in Ubuntu 20.10 and later versions.

Conda is a multi-platform package manager that can be used to install
gr-satellites and its dependencies (such as GNU Radio) in a virtual environment
that does not clash with the system-wide set up. It is the recommended way to
install gr-satellites in Windows and macOS, and also in Linux distributions
which do not include GNU Radio 3.8.

It is also possible to build gr-satellites from source, which is easy to do on
Linux systems, and perhaps also macOS, but not in Windows.

Finally, there are a number of distributions that provide their own packages for
gr-satellites:

* `Arch Linux`_, through the AUR
* `Debian Linux`_ (testing and unstable releases)
* `MacPorts`_

.. _Arch Linux: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gr-satellites-git/
.. _Debian Linux: https://packages.debian.org/sid/gr-satellites
.. _MacPorts: https://ports.macports.org/port/gr-satellites/
